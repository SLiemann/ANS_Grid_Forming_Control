The folder structure is as follows:

grid: contains the ANS grid model
lines: contains line models, like simple transmission lines and transformers
nodes: contains node models, which are here mainly the GFM converters, loads and auxillary nodes as short-circuits
operationpoint: includes the scripts to calculate a load flow for finding an equilibrium with subsequent initialization of the dynamic model

Files:

run_simulations.jl: Runs a simulation (building and initialising the model first) and plotting the result.

stability_limit.jl: exmaple of how to run mutiple simulations wiht subsequent determination of the stability limit

include_custom_nodes_lines_utilities.jl:  includes the files in the above mentioned folders

utility_functions.jl: contains some auxillary functions for modelling and simulation
