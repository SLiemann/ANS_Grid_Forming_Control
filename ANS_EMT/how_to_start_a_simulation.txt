To start a simulation in Simulink the following steps should be carried out:

1. Choose whether you want to run a simulation for shor-term OR long-term voltage stability
2. Open the corresponding simulink model "ANS_GFM"
3. Run the corresponding "init_ANS_GFM" script. Please make sure that you are on the highest 
   visible level of the simulink model. Otherwise an error could show up.
4. Now the user has the choice to run a single simulation or multiple simulations in parallel.
  4.1 Single simulation: just run the model in simulink (make sure to activate the needed scopes to inspect the results)
  4.2 Multiple simultions: run the corresponding script "parallel_simulations" (here it is good to deactive all scopes to accelerate the simulations)

More comments can be found in the corresponding scripts.
